# MR-ML-Assessments
This repository holds assessments for the role Machine Learning Engineer at MapRecruit

# Submission deadline
 The submission deadline is exactly 7 days from the time you receive your "Round 2 Assessment" email. 

# Submission instructions
- Step 1: Create a Github repo where you will code over the 7 day period
- Step 2: Create an issue in this (Yoghurtyam/MR-ML-Assessments) GitHub repo (on the top) and add the link to your GitHub repo (the one created in Step 1) in the space for "Leave a comment". The "Title" should be of the format < Name > - < question assigned >

Do not make any additional changes after the deadline has passed. 


If you haven't used GitHub previously and think learning it will divert you from the problem at hand - send your code directly to `rana@maprecruit.ai` before the submission deadline. (Not recommended)

# After the Submission
Post the 7 day period there will an interview where you will be asked to present your solution and then we will discuss the approach you've taken. 

If you have any doubts, queries or concerns feel free to reach out to me at `rana@maprecruit.ai`.
