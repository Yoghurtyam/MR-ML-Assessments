# MR-ML-Assessments
This repository holds assessments for the role Machine Learning Engineer at MapRecruit

# Submission deadline
 The submission deadline is exactly 7 days from the time you receive your "Round 2 Assessment" email or from when you are assigned the task on the call. 

# Submission instructions
- Step 1: **(Day One)** Create a Github repo where you will code over the 7 day period. Create this on day one so we know you're working on the project. 
- Step 2: **(Day One)** Send a mail to `rana@maprecruit.ai` with the link to your GitHub repo. The subject of the mail should be "< Your name > - < Task name >". Example: "Rana Prathap - Chatbot". 
- Step 3: **(Day Seven)** Before your deadline has passed on the 7th day - send out an email to `rana@maprecruit.ai` saying you have completed your task. The subject of the mail should be "< Your name > - Completed task < Task name >". Example: "Rana Prathap - Completed task Chatbot"

Do not make any additional changes after the deadline has passed. 

***Important***: You are only supposed to solve the single task assigned to you via mail or during the call. 

If you haven't used GitHub previously and think learning it will divert you from the problem at hand - send your code directly to `rana@maprecruit.ai` before the submission deadline. Also send an email saying that you have begun working on the task for our information. (Using Github is recommended)

# After the Submission
Post the 7 day period there will an interview where you will be asked to present your solution and then we will discuss the approach you've taken. How you will present your solution is up to you.

If you have any doubts, queries or concerns feel free to reach out to me at `rana@maprecruit.ai`. 

Thank you for applying to MapRecruit and good luck with your task! Happy Coding!
