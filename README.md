# Submission instructions
- Step 1: Create a Github repo where you will code over the 7 day period. Create this on day one so we know you're working on the project. 
- Step 2: [Create an issue](https://github.com/Yoghurtyam/MR-ML-Assessments/issues) in this (Yoghurtyam/MR-ML-Assessments) GitHub repo (on the top) and add the link to your GitHub repo (the one created in Step 1) in the space for "Leave a comment".

Do not make any additional changes after the deadline has passed. 

***Important***: You are only supposed to solve the single task assigned to you via mail. 

If you haven't used GitHub previously and think learning it will divert you from the problem at hand - send your code directly to `rana@maprecruit.ai` before the submission deadline. Also send an email saying that you have begun working on the task for our information. (Not recommended)

# After the Submission
Post the 7 day period there will an interview where you will be asked to present your solution and then we will discuss the approach you've taken. 

If you have any doubts, queries or concerns feel free to reach out to me at `rana@maprecruit.ai`.
